# ezd6-roll-messages
D6 rolls are shown using Font-Awesome glyphs with pips
Automation of formatting roll messages is based on flavor text
If the flavor text has 'attack' in it and the roll result is 6 (5 if the text also contains 'brutal'), the chat message will have a button for rolling another die to confirm the critical.
Right clicking roll messages will show the message context menu. This menu has:
 - Use Karma (not on rolls with flavor with 'spell' or 'miracle')
 - Use Hero Die
 - Keep Highest (net boon)
 - Keep Lowest (net bane)
 - Change Flavor
Using these options will update the message and show the actions that were taken on the message
